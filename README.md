# Hello Wordle

A simple Wordle clone.

Rules:
- Green indicates a letter in the right position.
- Yellow indicates a letter in the incorrect position.
- Grey indicates a letter that does not exist in the word.

The logic of this clone should mirror the one used on the official Wordle website. Please reach out with a screenshot if you find any bugs during play!
